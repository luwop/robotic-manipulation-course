def fb(n):
    """
    Implements the Fizz Buzz sequence. This function takes
    a positive integer n and printes out a single line for each 
    integer from 1 to n.

    For each i from 1 to n:
        - if i is divisible by 3 and 5, print fizzbuzz.
        - if i is divisible by 3 but not 5, print fizz.
        - if i is divisible by 5 but not 3, print buzz.
        - otherwise, print the number i.

    Before you program, draw out the results for these two function calls.
